This is a simulation of the periodic review ordeirng model known in the Supply Chain domain. I used it as the base code for my work at Walmart. There's plenty of documentation online about the maths of this model. One of the websites that I find helpful is https://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/periodic-review-system-inventory-management-models-a-tutorial
